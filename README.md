A 3-month-old baby died in SoHo Daycare in July 2015. SoHo Daycare is operated for 14 years without a license. Another incident was a 3-year-old girl who died in a daycare in Long Island on December 2018. Recently, in January 2019, a 4-month-old baby died in a daycare in Brooklyn. Al these incidents are the worst nightmares for all parents. One of the biggest concerns of working parents is to provide high-quality childcare for their children. A daycare can cost them as much as a college tuition. However, they would like to trust and be sure that childcare centers provide a safe and healty environment for their precious child.    

Health departments conduct inspections and surveillances across America to monitor safety level of childcare centers. However, the checks are insufficient in preventing the rising number of violations. This project addresses the need for improved surveillance and additional precautions. The analysis of New York City childcare inspection data tries to answer that can a parent predict the safety level of a childcare center.
 
Two data sets used for the analysis. First one is the DOHMH(Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) Child Care Inspection Data. The second one is social media data imported from Yelp. This data set used to analyze the parent reviews for each childcare centers. For more information about the data and the cleaning process, please see the links below:

Childcare centers are annually inspected by New York City childcare inspection office. The data is formed as summary of inspection visits for past three years. Each row represents an inspection visit to a specific facility. However majority of them inspected more than three based on an observed violation or complaints. The exploratory data analysis process contain the analysis of different features and their relations.  For more information about the exploratory data analysis process, please see the links below:
